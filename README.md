#Webpack Tests

   A playground webpack repo using Yarn, Docker and Webpack for dev and prod.

## Requirements
This project use Docker, and this is why you don't need more requirements
that `docker`, `docker-compose` and `npm` or `yarn` (just if you want run the `compose` npm script... which I commend in development)

## Run
### Development
In development you just need to run
    ```yarn run compose up```
        or
    ```npm run compose up```
